In this project, I performed a data analysis of a Lyft dataset to identify trends and forecast demand. I did this using Python (numpy, matplotlib) and Jupyter Notebook.

Key insights: The analysis of Lyft bike demand revealed certain trends based on time, day, season, and user type. 
Peak hours occur at 7:00-9:00 and 17:00-18:00, with demand peaking at 8:00 (358 bikes) and 17:00 (460 bikes), indicating heavy commuting use. 
Demand is steady throughout the week but highest on Thursdays and Fridays, with Sunday seeing the lowest usage. 
Seasonally, spring has the lowest demand, while fall experiences the highest. 
Registered users show higher fluctuations and peak on weekends, suggesting recreational use, while casual users peak Monday-Wednesday, likely due to commuting. 
Demand declines as weather worsens, especially during rain, but cloudiness has minimal impact.
